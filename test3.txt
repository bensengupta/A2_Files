little lamb, Mary had a little lamb

And everywhere that Mary went
Mary went, Mary went, everywhere
that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go.
The gender pay gap partly owes to the differential allocation of female 
and male workers across occupations, wrote Moyser. Women are 
overrepresented in low paying occupations and underrepresented in high

female fields like teaching, nursing, social work, sales, service or 
administration, according to the report.
